These files were provided by XXX on behalf of the LUCKS collaboration an explanation for each is provided below, for questions please contact xyz@LUCKmail.com

*LUCKS_efficiency.dat*
---------------------------
This file contains columns of recoil energy in keV and the corresponding nuclear recoil efficiency at that energy.
More information can be found in fig.X of arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX

*LUCKS_resolution.dat*
---------------------------
This file contains columns of recoil energy in keV and the corresponding detector energy resolution at that energy.
More information can be found in fig.X of arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX

*LUCKS_background.dat*
---------------------------
This file contains columns of recoil energy in keV and the corresponding background rate in DRU at that energy.
More information can be found in fig.X of arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX

*LUCKS_isotopes.dat*
---------------------------
This file contains a list of isotopes present in the detector, columns give Z, A and fractional abundance by weight. 

*LUCKS_run.dat*
---------------------------
This file contains a list of all LUCKS experimental runs, columns give name, exposure, number of observed events, then filenames for the relevant detector specifications.
